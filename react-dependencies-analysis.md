# React Dependencies Analysis and Solution

## Identified Issues

1. **Duplicate React Dependencies:**
   - The root project has React ^18 as a peer dependency
   - The example folder also has React ^18 as a direct dependency
   - Both projects are using Next.js, with the example using version ^15.1.3 and the root project also using ^15.1.3

2. **Package Structure Issues:**
   - The root project is a UI component library that should have React as a peer dependency (which it correctly does)
   - The example project should be using the root project as a dependency, but there's no local link setup visible

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Update Example Project's package.json:**
   - Remove the direct Next.js dependency from the root project since it's a UI component library
   - Update the example project to use a stable version of Next.js (version 15 is not a valid version - latest stable is 14.x)
   - Add a local link to the root project in the example's dependencies

2. **Required Changes:**
   
   In the root `package.json`:
   ```json
   - Remove "@types/next": "^9.0.0"
   - Remove "next": "^15.1.3"
   ```

   In the example `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "next": "^14.2.13",
       "@nodegeeks/ui-components": "file:../",
       // ... other dependencies
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Setup Instructions:**
   1. First, build the root project: `npm run build`
   2. In the example folder, run: `npm install`
   3. In the example folder, run: `npm link ../ `
   4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

This should resolve the React-related compilation issues by ensuring proper dependency management and preventing duplicate React instances.
